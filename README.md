# Application of Machine learning algorithms for Laptop Price Prediction using Regression.

In this project I have basically executed the regression task of predicting laptop price by different Machine learning models and compared their performances.

• Performed Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and feature selection.

• Split dataset into train set and test set.

• Performed some Data Visualization using Seaborne's and Matplotlib plots like Heatmaps, Barplots, Scatter plot, Histograms, KDE plots and other plots to know data more closely.

• Trained some regression algorithms like: Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, KNN nearest neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest Regressor, Extra trees in Random forest regression, boosting methods such as Ada boost, Gradient boosting and XgBoost.

• Fitted the model on test set and obtained the accuracy.

• Evaluated the model performance and accuracy of each model in predicting laptop price and concluded that Random forest outperformed all the algorithms.

• The Random Forest Regressor performed the best with R2 score of 0.887 and MAE of 0.158.
